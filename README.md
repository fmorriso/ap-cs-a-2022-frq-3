# AP CS A - 2022 - FRQ #3
A runnable solution to the 2022 AP CS A Exam FRQ #3
## Notes:
* To make it easier to run in Java IDE's such as jGrasp, I set the Eclipse project properties to generate the `.class` files in the same directory as the `.java` files.
* I made the default constructor in `Review` private to prevent creation of uninitialized instances.
* I created a method <code>addReview</code> to add Reviews to the array.
* I used a variable <code>numReviewsFilled</code> to keep track of how many array positions were filled.
